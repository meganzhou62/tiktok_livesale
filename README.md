# Tiktok Livesale Visualization Project 
This is the github page for the project of Jessie Wang, Jingyuan Chen and Megan Zhou. We're doing this project as the final assignment of the class Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization at Columbia in Fall 2021. 

In this project, we're studying about Chinese live commerce by studying data of different selling revenue of Douyin hosts. 
By deep-diving into the data and reflecting on some trends and patterns that live e-commerce has in China, we generated an analysis that will be helpful for anyone who is interested in starting steaming commerce business in the US. 
Our final conclusion includes:
- Celebrities do not have advantages over KOLs in live streaming sales, as both groups have their special features and are appealing to their specific targeting viewers.
- When a lot of people like or comment on a hostsâ€™ videos, the live stream of that hosts are more likely to become popular and generate more revenues. This effect is more obvious in the celebrity group.
- The timing of the livestream, as long as the average duration of customers viewing the livestream does influence the sells. 

To view the full report of the project, including how we got our data and our process of transforming the data, and the steps and result of our analysis, you're welcome to copy and paste the book URL (meganzhou62.github.io/tiktok_livesale/) to view it in your browser. It also has some interative component in Chapter 6. I highly recommend checking it out. 

The technology in this project include R and Javascript (D3). Thanks to our instructor, the report was initially generated from a bookdown template: https://github.com/jtr13/EDAVtemplate.
