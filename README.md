This is the github page for the project of Jessie Wang, Jingyuan Chen and Megan Zhou. We're doing this project as the final assignment of the class Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization at Columbia in Fall 2021. 

In this project, we're studying about Chinese live commerce by studying data of different selling revenue of Douyin hosts. The book URL is here: meganzhou62.github.io/tiktok_livesale/.
