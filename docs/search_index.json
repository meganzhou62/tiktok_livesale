In fact, by March 2020, the number of live commerce users had reached 265 million, accounting for 29.3% of the country’s total number of internet users, and that was only before COVID-19 hit. By deep-diving into the data and reflecting on some trends and patterns that live e-commerce has in China, out group wish to generate an analysis that will be helpful for anyone who is interested in starting steaming commerce business in the US. One of the most popular platforms for live commerce in China is called ‘’Douyin’’, the Chinese version of Tiktok with more features available. There is a website called “Chanmama” (https://www.chanmama.com/) that collects and distributes data about live commerce happening on Douyin. Based on data fetched from the website, we will focus our study on how hosts, products, live streaming timing, and related short-videos impacted the total revenue generated from the live e-commerce. Although everyone is able to sell products on Douyin, most revenues are generated by hosts who are either celebrities or key opinion leaders (KOLs). In our analysis, celebrities are defined as famous singers/actors/actresses in China who are known by the public before starting the live streaming sales and KOLs are those who are known as a result of live-streaming sales or publishing short videos on Douyin. The difference between those two groups is compared throughout our project and we will mainly study the top 20 hosts ranked by revenue generated. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Our dataset was collected from a website called “Chanmama” (https://www.chanmama.com/), which is the largest database that collects and distributes data about “Douyin”. It provides data that includes some general information of the live hosts, the detailed revenue of each live stream, and information on the products sold during each live stream. However, since this database currently only covers data of “Douyin”, it is only available in Chinese, which means some additional translations are required. Also, users must register and subscribe first to gain access to the data. The raw data is in Excel format, and it is located under each live host’s profile. Each live host has three own Excel files storing the data focusing on three different areas, and we can only download the files one by one instead of in just one step. We took advantage of the sales revenue ranking system provided by the database to see who were the Top 20 live hosts in terms of sales revenue from June to August 2021. Then, we downloaded the data files from these 20 live host profiles and combined them into three single Excel files. The first Excel file is named as Data_Livestream_General, and it includes general information about each past live stream of the hosts from Jun to Aug 2021. To help our analysis, we decided to add 3 additional columns to the dataset, including the host’s full name (Name), whether is an online KOL or celebrity (Host_category), and the host’s occupation (Occupation). Name and occupation were available on the website not was not contained in the downloaded excel s we mannually added those. We also decided host category based on our team’s common knowledge. After the adjustment, there are a total of 21 variables and 20000+ observations in this dataset and we use them selectively. These variables mainly are numeric data, important ones including the start time of live steam, the number of products presented, the number of goods sold, total sales amount, duration, views, and the average length of stay. The second Excel file is named as Data_Sales, and it includes detailed information about the specific goods sold by the 20 hosts within the three months. Again, to help our analysis, we add the host’s full name as an additional identifier column. After the adjustment, there are a total of 9 variables and more than 10000 observations. These variables include two categorical columns, the goods category, and the host’s name. The rest variables are all numeric data, including a specific good’s retailing price in the Chinese Yuan, commission rate, sales volume. sales amount, conversion rate, the number of appearances of a good on short videos, and the number of appearances on live streaming. The third Excel file is named as Data_Short_Videos, and it gives us information about posted short videos of the top 20 hosts from Jun to Aug 2021. It includes 9 variables and 18051 observations in total. Just like in the previous data file, we added in an additional identifier column Name to the original raw data. This dataset tells us information on video post time, duration, estimated sales volume units from the video, estimated sales amount, number of likes of the video, number of comments, and number of reposts. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation After we gathered the data, we started our data cleaning to make it more convenient for us to work with the data in R. The first thing we did was to use Python to convert the time variables. The script in Python can be found in our github folder at https://github.com/meganzhou62/tiktok_livesale/blob/main/processed%20data/assignmentand%20data/data%20processing/transfer%20duration%20to%20seconds.ipynb. This was necessary because we had time data in digit plus time unit in Chinese, and they were in different units including hour, minute and second. Thus, we matched the Chinese character with different unit of time and converted all time variable into the number of seconds. We did the conversion to the duration of the live stream, the average duration per viewer in the Data_Livestream_general.xlsx and the video duration in Data_Short_Videos.xlsx. We also changed the Host_category variable from F/T to K/C, as in K standing for KOL and C standing for celebrities. This change could make our later visualization clearer. For the category of items, we had a look at the over twenties different categories and eventually combined them into seven bigger categories for better analysis and visualization. To further organized our data, we removed the Chinese title of each session of live stream and assign an unique id to each session. Finally, we also did some data transformation in R. This includes changing char variable to numeric, changing Name variable into factor and reordering the Name variable by the total revenue each host generated. Besides the transformation mentioned above, for our interactive component, we also processed our data in Python (code at https://github.com/meganzhou62/tiktok_livesale/blob/main/processed%20data/Make%20cumulative%20data.ipynb). We grouped the revenue by each host and date, and got the cumulative sum by each host. We also printed it out in a specific way so that it fits into the js data format. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values We found there are very interesting patterns in the missing values of “Data_Livestream_General_processed.xlsx”. Here is the image we get for all of the missing patterns: For our purpose of showcasing the missing pattern, we shortened all the column name so that they would not overlap with our function. It is noticeable to us that the most common missing pattern is to have Per_customer_transaction, Sales_conversion_value_ratio, Number_of_goods_sold, Number_of_products and Total_sales_amount missing. While this pattern is the most frequent among all the missing patterns, the case where only Per_customer_transaction and Sales_conversion_value_ratio are missing is almost at the same missing frequency. With this information, we did some exploration to see what are the difference between rows that have valid Per_customer_transaction, Sales_conversion_value_ratio value and those rows that are missing Per_customer_transaction, Sales_conversion_value_ratio. We first looked at the livestram host to see if that column is related to our missing value. This image shows the distribution of hosts, with valid Per_customer_transaction, Sales_conversion_value_ratio value (on the left) or not (on the right). We can see that compared to data of other hosts, data for Liu Fang Posture Corrector have a much larger of probability of Per_customer_transaction, Sales_conversion_value_ratio value being null. When we compared the distribution of hosts when consider whether Number_of_goods_sold, Number_of_products and Total_sales_amount missing are missing, the difference in host distribution is not so significant (see image below). Thus the frequent missing pattern where Per_customer_transaction, Sales_conversion_value_ratio are missing is related to this host Liu Fang Posture Corrector. After we took a closer look, we found Liu Fang Posture Corrector would host a livestream for a long duration without selling any item. In this case, Per_customer_transaction, Sales_conversion_value_ratio values are null while Number_of_goods_sold, Number_of_products and Total_sales_amount are mostly 0. We then looked at the case where all Per_customer_transaction, Sales_conversion_value_ratio, Number_of_goods_sold, Number_of_products and Total_sales_amount are missing and compared the duration of the livestream when Per_customer_transaction, Sales_conversion_value_ratio, Number_of_goods_sold, Number_of_products and Total_sales_amount are missing. Here we found that the data with Per_customer_transaction, Sales_conversion_value_ratio, Number_of_goods_sold, Number_of_products and Total_sales_amount missing usually come with low livestream duration. After carefully examination, we found such rows should be the cases when the hosts only stream briefly for testing. Similar cases exist when we explore the rows with Average_length_of_stay missing. We should also note that these null values shall not be an obstacle to our project as these values are here because they hosts are not selling items or they are selling too few items. The only variable that is missing and is related to our analysis is the Total_sales_amount. For the purpose of our analysis, we will mostly sum the sales amount of live steams in each day together to get the daily revenue, we can drop these rows with missing re during our later process. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Do celebrities have an advantage over KOLs in live streaming sales? 5.2 Relationship between short video feedback and live streaming sales 5.3 Best time for a live streaming sale", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Do celebrities have an advantage over KOLs in live streaming sales? 5.1.1 Overview of the sale revenue distribution This graph gives an overview of the sale revenue distribution per day. We can see from the graph that daily revenue distribution is right skewed for both celebrities and KOLs. Most daily sales from June 2021 to August 2021 were less than 20 million Chinese Yuan (~3.2m US dollars). Both celebrities and KOLs had generated sales that were more than 50M yuan with celebrities having more positive outliers than KOLs. We can also see from the graph that KOLs held more live stream than celebrities within the three months. When exploring the data, we found that some host held more than 1 live streams per day. With further investigation, we found there were three scenarios: 1) Some hosts experienced technical issues so they had to end current session and start another session; 2) Some hosts ended the session for lunch/dinner break and restart a new one; 3) Some hosts first started a session without selling goods and then switched to a new session to sell. Therefore, we decided to group sessions that happened in the same day together and track daily performance. The following graph shows number of days they host a live stream from June to August 2021. 5.1.2 Total number of days steaming: KOLs host more streaming than celebrities From the graph, we see that Liu Fang, Luo yonghao, and Liuyuanyuan almost held sessions every day.It is clear that KOLs were broadcasting more frequently than celebrities, which is reasonable since most KOLs were broadcasting for their own products (ex. Liu Fang and Liu Yuanyuan) and other KOLs usually signed contracts with companies and thus had a minimal number of days they need to broadcast. Celebrities, on the other hand, had other jobs to do so they didn’t broadcasting as frequently. Luo Yonghao is an outlier in the celebrities group: he was first known by the public as an entrepreneur and actor but now he changed his focus to live stream sales. 5.1.3 Relationship between days of livestream and revenue Now, let’s look at the relationship between days of live stream and revenue. The graph shows KOLs generated more revenues than celebrities overall. Again, Luo Yonghao is an outlier among these top 20 hosts with much more revenue generated. Actually, he is the most successful host in Douyin. Now, let’s explore the revenue difference between the two groups further and look at the average revenue per day. Here, we found another outlier Jia Nailiang, who had very large daily sales and only held a couple sessions. After some research, we found that he just started live steam sales in mid-Aug and only had two days of broadcasting. Usually, when a celebrity just started to sell goods, he/she would get very good discounts from the business so the price were really attractive to consumers. Fans would also buy a lot to support them. Therefore, for our analysis, we will view Jia Nailiang as an outlier and we will keep track of his future performance and see if his data changed. After removing Jia Nailiang, it’s easier to see most celebrities held less than 20 session in the 3 months but they were able to generate more daily revenues. Qi Wei,Lou Yixiao, Zhang Ting, and Zhu Zixiao are famous actresses and they had decent average sales. Another interesting insights we got from the graph is that KOLs were clustered as two groups: a group with large number of live streams but lower average sales and the other group with fewer live streams but more average sales. Just looking from the host name, we think it’s probably a result of product mix. For example, Mr.Dong Jewelry had most average sale among the 19 hosts; from his name, he was probably selling mostly jewelry whose unit price is high and consumers don’t buy jewelries as frequently. We will look more into the product mix in the next section. 5.1.4 Overview of the product mix The above graphs give an overview of the product mix for each host among 7 main categories ordered by total revenues. It can be seen that celebrities sold products across most categories and almost all of them sold most in beauty (again, Luo Yonghao is an outlier). KOLs, on the other hand, generated most revenue from 1-3 categories that they had a close relationship with. Let’s zoom in and look at each group with details. From the graph, we can see Mr.Dong made most money from selling jewelries because he owned the jewelry shop. Zi An, Qiu Yingying and Lovemimius all generated most sales in clothing and they also had their own online stores selling clothes. For four of them, they mainly promoted their own products. Viewers in their room should have had the expectation about what they were watching and potentially buying. In the other words, people who came to their rooms should already have a potential interest in the goods. Other KOLs are selling multiple categories of goods and a majority of them did become famous because of short videos and in that sense, they are more like online-celebrities. The product mix for celebrities are quite different. Besides Luo Yonghao, most celebrities sold all kinds of good with a higher percentage in beauty. This is not hard to understand after thinking through it. E-commerce is not the major income source for celebrities and they don’t usually sign an exclusive agreement with any companies. Therefore, they usually sold whatever goods found by their assistances either with high commissions or high discounts (so they would attract more people and increase their reputations). The fact that celebrities didn’t specialize in one category attracted people with different interests and again diversified what they sell. Another interesting fact is that the most popular category among celebrities is beauty. We think it is due to two reasons. Firstly, beauty is the most popular e-commerce categories overall. Unlike clothes, people don’t need to try on before buying, which makes it easier for e-commerce. Also, beauty products usually have more discounts online and their price elasticity is high (not necessities as household goods). Therefore, lowering the price would trigger more sales. On the other hand, celebrities usually have good-looking. As a result, they are more convincing when promoting a beauty product. 5.1.5 Insights and findings Overall, it agrees with our hypothesis that consumers came to KOL because they have expertise in a specific category and came to celebrities because of their reputation. 5.2 Relationship between short video feedback and live streaming sales 5.2.1 Relationship between the number of like, comments, and repost of the videos and the daily revenues of live streams If we have a look at the relationship between the number of like, comments, and repost of the videos posted by each host and the daily revenues of live streams generated, we find that there’s a positive correlation of average revenue to the average likes and comments received by each host’s video. However, this relationship exist only for the celebrities. For the KOL, there’s almost no correlation between their average daily revenue to the average likes and comments for their videos. One thing that we also notice is that the average number of reposts received by the videos is also uncorrelated to the number of revenue generated by each hosts, no matter these hosts are celebrities or KOLs. This could be partly explained by the following image, where we created a scatter plot for the number of like, comments and reposts received by all of the videos in our data. While the number of likes is highly correlated by the number of comments. The number of reposts appears to be not correlated with either comments or likes. Thus, we conclude while people exhibit the same pattern for liking or commenting a douyin video, they exhibit a different pattern for reposting a video, and this different pattern is less related to whether people would actually shop when the poster of these video conduct a live stream. 5.2.2 Relationship of average number of likes and comments versus some other statistic of each session of live streams To further investigate why the number of likes and comments are correlated to the daily revenue for celebrities. We explored the relationship of average number of likes and comments versus some other statistics of each session of live streams, including the number of viewers, the number of gifts received, the number of new fans, etc. Here we found that the average number of likes and comments of a host was also correlated to the number of viewers entering a live stream conducted by this host. Compared to the daily revenue, the average number of viewer is more strongly correlated to the number of likes and comments. We also notice that this relationship is much stronger for celebrities compared to KOL. 5.2.3 Insights and findings Thus, we conclude that whether they are a lot of people likes or comments on a hosts’ videos may direct influence the number of viewers of each live stream of the hosts, because people who like or comment on a host’s videos would probably lead to people’s further action of going into the host’s live stream room and check out what the host is selling. However, for celebrities, this action of going into hosts’ room would more likely result in people actually buying stuff, while this is not the same for KOLs. 5.3 Best time for a live streaming sale 5.3.1 Difference between Weekdays and weenkends Do people tend to buy more on weekdays, on weekends, or there is no difference? To gain insights on the relationship of purchasing power to the day of the week, we visualize the total sales amount (Revenue) by each day in the week through a violin plot. To make sure that only the valid live streaming counts in our analysis, we will only include those live streaming last longer than 5 minutes so that the NA values can be eliminated. The plot tells us not only the mean, which is denoted by the red dot but also the distribution of the total sales amount for each day’s live streaming. For all 7 days, most of the sales are clustered in the bottom, while a small number of large values are pulling the mean up. As this plot shows, the difference of the seven days in a week in terms of their distribution is not very obvious, as their distribution is similar. But we can still see that Thursday and Monday appear to have lower means compared to the other 5 days. This observation logically makes sense and might be related to consumer behavior in a week, as these two days are the most stressful during a workweek respectively. In general, people like to think of weekends as a time of rest and rejuvenation, and therefore people’s moods are typically at their lowest on Mondays and focus on the transition from relaxation to the new work or school week, which causes them to spend less time and money in watching live streaming. On the other hand, Thursday is the day right before Friday, the end of the work or school week, “the end of the week” feeling pushes people to be stressed and to focus more on their work or study, which might reduce their chance to watch live streaming and accordingly decrease the sales amount. Therefore, in general, selling on Monday and Thursday might be more challenging to generate higher revenue. The distribution of sales by the two groups of weekdays and weekends reveals that live streaming sales on weekends are more likely to generate a higher sales amount than those on weekdays. Live streaming sales on weekends also have a higher mean than those on weekdays. These observations suggest that selling on weekends is more likely to increase sales amount, which is in line with our intuition. 5.3.2 Starting time Does the start time of live streaming affect the sales amount? We plot the average total sales amounts in each hour to the start of the time of live streaming, and found those live-streaming started at 10 AM tends to generate a much higher average total sales amount. Those live streaming started at 10 AM appear to be able to achieve an average total sales amount more than 2 times higher than those live-streaming started in the afternoon. This observation suggests that live streaming starting around 10 AM might be the best choice to improve the average total sales amount. To further investigate, we plot the duration of live streaming to the starting time and found those live streaming started around 10 AM tend to have a longer live streaming duration. The smooth curve also indicates the same information that the live streaming started around 10 AM has the peaked duration, and after 10 AM, the duration decreases by time. In addition, the smooth curve shows a similar pattern as the plot of average total sales amounts in each hour (in millions of CNY) to the start of the time of live streaming, which indicates live streaming duration is positively related to the average total sales amounts in each hour. This plot reaffirms that live streaming duration is positively related to the average total sales amounts in each hour. Then we analyze the plot of average Sale Amount by hours to duration facet by whether the host is celebrity or KOL. As the plot shows, the slope of KOL is much steeper, which indicates that the positive relationship between the average total sales amounts in each hour and duration appears to be more significant for KOLs. 5.3.3 The relationship between average stay length and sales amount When analyzing a viewer’s average stay length in a host’s live streaming, we found an average stay time of 2.5 minutes appear to be the best choice, at which the total sales amount tends to be the highest, no matter the host is a KOL or not. Also, the stay time of KOL’s streaming room scattered more dispersed than that of celebrities, ranging from 1 to 8 minutes. On the other hand, the data points of celebrities are more clustered, and most of them are less than 3 minutes. 5.3.4 Insights and findings Based on the observations above, we can sum up that no matter the host is a KOL or not, an average stay time of 2.5 minutes in the live streaming room appears to generate most sales. Also, live streaming started around 10 AM tends to have a longer duration as well as a higher average total sales amounts. In addition, selling on weekends is more likely to increase sales amount, whereas Monday and Thursday might be less favorable choices.

Using appropriate data visualization and analysis, we found several interesting and noteworthy observations: In general, consumers came to KOL because they have expertise in a specific category and came to celebrities because of their reputation. Therefore, the answer to the question of whether celebrities have advantages over KOLs in live streaming sales is ambiguous, as both groups have their special features and are appealing to their specific targeting viewers. When a lot of people like or comment on a hosts’ videos, the live stream of that hosts are more likely to become popular and generate more revenues. The reason might be viewers who like or comment on a host’s video would probably watch their broadcast and spend while watching. The effect is more obvious in the celebrity group. No matter the host is a KOL or a celebrity, stated broadcasting at 10am appears to be the best choice to generate more sales. Also, an average stay of 2.5 minutes is related with a decent total sales. In addition, selling on weekends is more likely to increase sales amounts, whereas selling on Monday and Thursday might be less favorable choices. Given the above findings, we also noticed that our analysis has many limitations. For instance, there are a few obvious outliers that existed in our datasets. For example Jia Nailiang, a famous Chinese celebrity known for his affairs, just entered this business, but he achieved a very high level of sales amount, greatly surpassing a lot of other hosts who have already been in this industry for many years. We will continue to track his progress and to see if he can maintain his efficiency and popularity in the next couple of months. In addition, we realized nowadays, it is really challenging to tell the boundary between KOLs and celebrities, as more and more celebrities started to use the Internet as the main method to promote themselves and to expand their influence. A typical example is Luo Yonghao, who is famous from his early life and now actively participates in online events and takes them as an opportunity to expand his influence. We might need additional scrutiny in defining the boundary. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
